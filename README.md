# 🛰️ Team Atlas: Collegiate Gaming Discord Bot

> A lightweight Discord bot built for collegiate gamers — helping teams stay organized, track performance, and stay connected.

---

## 📘 Overview
**Team Atlas** is creating a Discord bot tailored for **collegiate gaming communities**. The goal is to simplify how students manage practices, scrimmages, tournaments, and meetings while maintaining balance with their academic schedules.  
Since most collegiate gamers already use Discord, this bot adds missing organizational and community-building features.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Collegiate gamers need better tools for:
- Scheduling and managing events around classes  
- Tracking team and player performance  
- Keeping gameplay fun and coordinated across campuses  

This bot makes all of that possible — within Discord itself.
